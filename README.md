# Expense-Tracker-Web-Application
This is a simple Expense Tracker web application that helps users manage and monitor their incomes and expenses. Users can add transactions by entering a description and an amount, where positive values represent income and negative values represent expenses. The app dynamically updates the displayed balance, total income, and total expenses based on the transaction history. Each transaction can also be removed individually. The application uses browser local storage to persist data, ensuring that the transaction list is saved even after the page is refreshed. It features a clean and responsive interface with instant feedback on financial status, making budgeting easier and more accessible. The project is implemented using plain JavaScript for interactivity and DOM manipulation, with minimal dependencies for easy customization and extension.
